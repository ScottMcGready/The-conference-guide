# Volunteers

The unspoken heros of any conference but attendees all the same. Make sure you look after these folks and you'll have guarunteed folks to help you run your conference from years to come.

Outside of the special characters from AV.

## Room Setup

Coming along on the Friday and helping getting the talk, sponsor, workshop rooms all setup. Moving chairs, tables, putting the little chocolate mints on the pillows, moving the podium back and forward, and making sure all the lights have bulbs, etc.

## Eventbrite Organiser Setup

This involves a quick day before sessions for those who will be doing the event Greeting on the Saturday where you will walk about with a clipboard and highlighters OR the eventbrite organiser app to scan tickets and all the different ticket types. Anyone that does manage to attend the training on how to do this will be responsible for teaching those who didn't.

After that is done, you'll also decide and setup the welcome tables. From these tables we will be handing out: bags, lanyards, etc.

## Volunteer Debrief

Only one session attendance is mandatory.

Attending a session lead by the organiser team to tell us all how to do our jobs and issue the wanted posters. Concluded with a quick Q&A for all the questions they haven't asked themselves like when Brian is going to eat the massive bag of Borsch he won at BSides BSK.

## Greeters

Welcoming people at the entrance, scanning badges, issuing swag bags and wishing them bon voyage. Make sure you're aware of all the different ticket types for this one.

## Roamers

Just going for a walk in your fancy red goon T-Shirt along a NPC style patrol path and being stopped every 5-10 seconds by someone asking where the Bathroom is or when their favorite speaker is going to be talking.

## Sponsor Support

Hanging out with the people that gave us money and fetching them their scheduled tea, earl gray, hot.

## Sticker Stall

Making sure people don't leave IOU notes instead of real money when they get stickers from the sticker stall or generally "take the piss". Do we even have a sticker stall at BSides LDN?

## Quiet Room Keeper

Someone who's hanging out in the quiet room offering general support to those who come in. Kind of like a roamer but less walking.
