# Track crew

This splits down into sub-roles you need on each track.

* Ushers
* AV Camera folk
* MC folk

First timers will typically do 1 person on AV and one person doing both usher and MC. Experienced (or skeleton) crews can have a singular goon doing all three.

## Ushers

This variation of human sign post should be used in particularly busy venues or when it gets a bit too loud in the corridors outside a speaker track. Genuinely an important role to ensure that people can enter and leave with minimum disruption. If you are keeping this role you might want to keep in mind the easiest way for someone to slip into a talk part way and give folks a wee pointer so they don't disrupt the talk more than they have to. You would also be responsible for ensuring the room doesn't overfill, typically not a concern until the conference has reached a certain scale.

## AV

AV typically first to arive and last to leave, arriving the night before a con and setting up the tracks where possible. Then on the day of the conference AV crew would be expected to babysit the [rigs][Rigs] and at the end of the day tear everything back down any any [digital hygiene requested from Cooper][Rigs].

Get familiar with the AV kit by helping Cooper set it up.

### Setup

- Decide where the camera and present will be for the best line of sight,
- pointing the cameras in the right direction,
- reeling out powerleads to the wrong end of the room and then subsequently fixing it,
- plugging everything in,
- booting the [rigs][Rigs] and making sure it's working as intended,
- turning the computer off and on again,
- setup of microphones and speakers,
- ensuring all the adapters for the speaker laptop is ready to go.

### Day plan

- Stop and start the recordings between speakers,
- update the current speaker information,
- tracking the shot with the video camera,
- keeping an eye on audio levels,
- help tear down the AV setup per track.

## MC folk

Help the speaker setup

- Get their laptop plugged into the AV,
- show them the [microphone good ettiqute](https://www.audiovisual.ie/mic-rental-etiquette-top-mic-tips/) and volume they'll need to speak,
- introduce them to some hand signals for 5 min left,
- ensure they know not to speak beyond their time,
- when they are ready introduce the speaker.

While the speaker is talking

- Ensure the speaker so they are not walking out of their alloted space,
- be prepared to signal them when they are going over their alloted time,

When the speaker is done speaking enable questions. If the room is large enough you could run around with a microphone. When going into lunches make sure to outro and let people know where to go.
